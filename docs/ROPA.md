## 2. Purpose of Processing

### 2.1 Description
The Telemetry Service collects **anonymous technical usage statistics** from the Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts. This data is used exclusively for:

- **Quality Improvement**: Identification of scripts with high failure rates
- **Prioritization**: Recognition of the most-used applications
- **Trend Analysis**: Understanding of used operating systems and resource configurations

### 2.2 Legal Basis
**Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR** (Legitimate Interest)

The legitimate interest lies in improving open-source software for the community. The processing is minimally invasive because:
- No personal data is collected
- No IP addresses are stored
- Data transmission is opt-in (users must actively consent)
